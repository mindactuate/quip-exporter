## The Quip Exporter

Quip is a great tool to create well formatted documents on desktop as well as on mobile devices. Unfortunately it lacks two important features:

1. To export all documents at once
2. To export to html or md including image files

This tool will perform a

- **full export** of your Quip account's
- **private & shared folders**.

The files will be exported as

- **HTML, md & docx** files
- **including all of your images**.

Please keep in mind that it will not loop through your recycle bin and starred folder.

## Get started

You can find the app at [mindactuate.github.io/quip-exporter](https://mindactuate.github.io/quip-exporter).

## Donating and a star

This app is a lot of work. Please consider donating just a little. :) You can [paypal me](https://www.paypal.me/mindactuate). ThatÂ´s an effort of 5 seconds.

Further I would be very happy about a Github star from you. :)
